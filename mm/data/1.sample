it now appear he could go home as earli as next week
the 11th circuit court of appeal in atlanta unanim reject a request by the rel for reconsider of a three judg panel s decis three week ago
the panel had upheld the us immigr and natur servic s refus to allow an asylum hear for elian say onli the child s father could make such a request
the rel sole remain opportun for an appeal is to the us suprem court
but the justic in washington are wide seen as unlik to accept the case if they are ask to do so both becaus there is no indic of previou judici error and becaus the three judg panel cite a suprem court rule as the rational for it own decis
analyst said the onli surpris about friday s seemingli conclus announc from atlanta wa that it had taken so long to reach
it feel like it s been forev get here but it s absolut the right decis said karen jacobsen a specialist in refuge and immigr polici at the fletcher school of intern law and diplomaci at tuft univers
it s in keep with american law and immigr polici
and it s in keep with what most peopl believ about famili that a child belong with hi parent and not with peopl he hardli know
the 12 judg of the 11th circuit evid share with mani observ of the case the feel that it wa time to write the last chapter of a saga that ha captiv the nation and spark intern controversi sinc elian wa discov float on an inner tube off the florida coast last novemb
he had surviv with two other a disastr boat trip from cuba in which hi mother and 10 other drown
after note that an injunct prevent elian s father from leav the unit state with hi son expir at 4 p m wednesday the five page rule said the appeal court will not entertain ani more request for a stay
the word not appear in overs and boldfac type
reaction to friday s develop wa mute especi compar to the intens and sometim raucou respons previou legal defeat for elian s rel have prompt
the cuban american commun in southern florida appear quiet and there wa no hint of gloat from anyon on the win side
we are pleas that the 11th circuit court of appeal ha act unanim in deni the motion for rehear attorney gener janet reno said in washington
now that the court ha conclus upheld our decis i am hope that thi father and son will soon be abl to move on with their live togeth
greg craig the attorney for elian s father releas a short statement that relay the same sentiment
it said in part
we believ that the in decis to recogn the right of juan miguel gonzalez to speak for hi son elian is consist with the rule of law and our nation s core valu and tradit
we are gratifi that the 11th circuit wa unanim in it decis to affirm those valu and those tradit
craig ad that the elder miguel and hi famili who have been live in suburban washington await a final disposit of the case look forward to resum a normal life
elian ha been in hi father s custodi sinc april 22 when feder agent forcibl remov him from the home of hi great uncl and cousin in the littl havana section of miami
hi rel who have lost everi judici decis in their effort to prevent hi return to cuba had argu that all 12 judg on the 11th circuit should rehear the case becaus the three judg panel drawn from their rank had er in it rule
but the full court adamantli disagre
seven of the dozen judg had to approv reconsider in order for it to occur but none even ask for a vote on the question
the clinton administr move forc monday to end the drama over elian gonzalez as offici took step to take custodi of the 6 year old boy from hi rel in miami as earli as thursday and return him to hi father in cuba
at the same time a feder appeal court in atlanta said it would hear argument in the case dure the week of may 8 an action that may make it more difficult for the justic depart to put it plan into effect
justic depart offici laid the groundwork for take control of elian by assert that the boy s miami rel had fail to compli with a govern request to say explicitli that they would not block hi return to hi father cuba if they lost their court fight
as a result the offici said they were consid revok an earlier decis allow elian to live with the rel in miami who have care for him sinc he wa rescu at sea in novemb
offici schedul a meet earli tuesday morn at the region offic of the immigr and natur servic in miami with the lawyer for elian s miami rel to tri to resolv the situat
but justic depart offici warn that they would insist on an unambigu statement from the rel that if they lost the legal appeal they would not obstruct effort to return elian to hi father
up to now the rel and their lawyer have said repeatedli that they would not violat ani law in their effort to keep elian in the unit state
but they have declin to be more specif and to compli with the justic depart s demand
kendal coffey a lawyer for the miami rel said in an interview we have said and we continu to affirm that the famili will obey the law
but ask if that mean that the famili agre to accept send elian back if the court rule against them coffey said that he wa reluct to speak to that becaus we are far from that moment
he said that he thought the gener statement that the famili would compli with the law wa more than suffici
justic depart lawyer disagre regard the care statement by the famili lawyer as hold on to their option to resist
last week david j kline a lawyer in the justic depart s immigr offic said that the govern had the author to termin permiss for elian s great uncl lazaro gonzal to have temporari custodi of the boy
but kline said the agenc would agre to that onli if the rel said clearli they would send elian back three day after they lost in the appeal court unless they obtain an injunct from a court allow them to file an expedit appeal with the suprem court
kline also demand that elian s famili in miami agre to an expedit schedul of argument befor the appeal court that would have the case argu and readi for a decis by april 4
but the appeal court monday may have made the depart s case more difficult by agre to a slower schedul
justic depart offici have grown increasingli impati with the tactic of the famili
some offici said that they might well move to take control of elian and send him back to cuba while the appeal are not yet complet
we have been more than gener said one offici
the miami rel have mount a legal campaign to keep elian in the unit state as support in congress and mani in miami s larg cuban american commun have ralli to their caus
elian wa found cling to a rubber tube last nov 25 after the boat he hi mother and sever other use in their attempt to come to the unit state capsiz
elian s mother and most of the other passeng drown
the effort of the miami rel to keep elian in the unit state suffer a setback last week when a feder judg dismiss a lawsuit request a polit asylum hear for the boy conclud that a long bitter legal battl wa not in elian s best interest

smith in havana with a john hopkin univers studi group said cuban exil may be hurt most by the battl as more american side with the u s govern s decis to send the boy home
